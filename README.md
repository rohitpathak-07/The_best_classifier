# IBM-Coursera-Machine-Learning-With-Python-final-project
Final project of IBM's course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python on Coursera

In this project we have load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data.
We have use the following algorithms to build our models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression


The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass

A simple comparison between KNN,SVM,Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models on a given data set of loans records.
final results:


| Algorithm          | Jaccard | F1-score | LogLoss |
|--------------------|---------|----------|---------|
| KNN                | 0.7222  | 0.7001   | NA      |
| Decision Tree      | 0.7777  | 0.7283   | NA      |
| SVM                | 0.7777  | 0.6212	  | NA      |
| LogisticRegression | 0.7592  | 0.6717   | 0.48003 |
